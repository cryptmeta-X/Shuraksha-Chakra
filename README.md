# Suraksha Chakra 

**Open Innovation Track Submission**  
**A Unified Digital Shield for India’s Informal Economy and Disaster Resilience**

Suraksha Chakra is a prototype Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed under the **Open Innovation Track** to protect and empower India’s informal economy by seamlessly combining daily business utilities with disaster survival and recovery systems.

It reimagines disaster response not as a standalone government or institutional function, but as a **continuity protocol for livelihoods**, embedded directly into the everyday tools used by small merchants, workers, and neighborhoods.

## Abstract

Nearly 80–90% of India’s workforce operates in the informal sector, which remains highly vulnerable to climate disasters, infrastructure failures, and connectivity shutdowns. When disasters strike, Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) experience a “Triple Death”:

1. **Asset Loss** – Physical inventory and infrastructure damage  
2. **Paper Loss** – Destruction of ledgers and proof of business activity  
3. **Identity Loss** – Inability to verify existence, solvency, or household composition  

Existing solutions are fragmented across fintech apps, weather alerts, and government portals, all of which assume an always-on network.

**Suraksha Chakra proposes a single, unified “Super PWA”** that dynamically transforms across three phases:

- **Prepare** – Daily business utility that builds verified economic data  
- **Survive** – Offline-first disaster response using community networks  
- **Recover** – Automated claims, instant credit, and supply-chain revival

## Problem Statement

### Vulnerability of the Informal Sector

India’s rapid digitalization through UPI, ONDC, and fintech platforms has brought millions of merchants online. However, these systems remain cloud-dependent. During floods, cyclones, or network shutdowns, merchants lose access to:

- Credit histories  
- Inventory records  
- Payment and lending channels  

At the exact moment emergency liquidity is required, the digital infrastructure collapses.

### Limitations of Institutional Disaster Response

Government platforms such as NDMA Sachet and ISRO Bhuvan provide top-down alerts and intelligence but:

- Treat citizens as passive recipients of aid  
- Are disconnected from local economic realities  
- Depend on the same fragile connectivity infrastructure  

This creates a critical “missing middle”: a **community-owned, offline-capable system** that treats economic continuity as essential to survival.

---

## Solution Overview

Suraksha Chakra is a **state-aware Progressive Web Application** that adapts automatically to:

- Connectivity conditions  
- Disaster scenarios  
- Post-event recovery requirements  

It functions as a profit-enhancing daily business tool during normal times, ensuring adoption and trust, and transforms into a decentralized resilience platform during emergencies.

## Application Lifecycle and Modes

### Phase 1: Prepare (Peace Mode – Daily Utility)

Also referred to as **Dukan-Sahayak**, this phase focuses on income stability and habit formation.

#### Smart Khata (Digital Ledger)
- Replaces physical credit notebooks  
- Records customer credit and repayments  
- Creates a persistent proof of solvency  

#### Mandi Connect (Price Discovery)
- Simulated ONDC integration  
- Displays commodity prices  
- Purchase activity contributes to inventory data  

#### Digital Twin (Inventory Proof)
- Builds a verified digital replica of shop assets  
- Eliminates the need for manual insurance inspections  

#### Suraksha Score
- Gamified resilience score (0–800)  
- Higher scores unlock preferential credit and recovery priority  

---

### Phase 2: Survive (War Mode – Disaster Response)

When connectivity fails or disaster conditions are triggered, the app switches into **offline-first emergency mode**.

#### Setu-Net (Offline Mesh Network)
- Community-level device-to-device communication  
- Enables SOS message propagation without cellular networks  

#### SOS Beacon
- Hold-to-activate distress signal  
- Designed for prioritization and misuse prevention  

#### Khoya-Paya (Lost and Found)
- Local missing-person registry  
- Enables family reunification at relief camps  

#### War Mode UX
- High-contrast interface  
- Large touch targets  
- Battery-efficient and stress-optimized design  

---

### Phase 3: Recover (Recover Mode – Phoenix Engine)

This phase focuses on rapid economic restoration.

#### E-Panchnama (Tatkal-Claim)
- AI-assisted damage assessment  
- Uses pre-disaster Digital Twin as baseline  
- Generates claim-ready documentation  

#### Cash-on-Wheels
- Mobile cash delivery via Banking Correspondents  
- Map-based tracking for transparency  

---

## Technical Architecture

Suraksha Chakra is architected as a **single-file Super Progressive Web Application**, aligned with Open Innovation principles of accessibility, scalability, and interoperability.

- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (CDN)  
- **Maps:** Leaflet.js with MapTiler  
- **Storage:** Browser localStorage (offline-first)  

### Data Strategy

- Centralized application state  
- Local-first persistence  
- Cloud synchronization only when connectivity returns  

---

## Installation and Setup

### Requirements
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)  
- Internet connection for initial CDN loading  

### Steps

## Vision and Impact

Suraksha Chakra represents a shift from **reactive disaster management** to **proactive, community-driven resilience**. By embedding survival infrastructure into daily economic activity, it ensures:

- Adoption before disasters occur  
- Preservation of economic identity during crises  
- Faster, automated recovery after disasters  

It protects livelihoods, not just lives.

## Future Roadmap (Open Innovation Extensions)

### 1. Mohalla-Mart (Hyper-Local Inventory Discovery)

**Core Logic:**  
Leverages existing Digital Twin inventory data to create a neighborhood-level discovery network.

- Shopkeepers expose real-time inventory as a discoverable catalog  
- Customers search nearby stores and walk in, with zero delivery fees  
- Increases footfall and sales without platform commissions  

**Disaster Utility:**  
Acts as a **Ration Radar**, allowing rescue teams to identify shops with essential stockpiles such as grains and medicines in affected areas.

---

### 2. Credit-Guard (Shared Udhaar Reputation)

Creates a community-led credit reputation layer for informal lending.

**Day-to-Day Utility:**
- Merchants anonymously flag chronic defaulters  
- Nearby shops receive risk alerts before extending credit
